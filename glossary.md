| Term | Description |
| :---: | :--- |
| üí± [**User**](concepts/stable-seekers/)\*\*\*\* | Someone using the protocol to get stablecoins from collateral or to redeem collateral from stablecoins. This is sometimes used interchangeably with the terms stable seeker \(for someone willing to get stablecoins\) or stable holder \(for someone owning Angle's stablecoins\). |
| üõ°Ô∏è[**Hedging Agent \(HA\)**](concepts/hedging-agents/)\*\*\*\* | Stakeholder of Angle's protocol helping to cover the protocol against price volatility of the accepted collateral types. Hedging Agents get long leveraged positions through perpetual futures from Angle, actually hedging the protocol in case of a decrease in price of the collateral.  |
| üçÄ [**Standard Liquidity  Providers \(SLP\)**](concepts/standard-liquidity-providers/)\*\*\*\* | The third type of stakeholders involved in the protocol are called SLPs. They add additional collateral to the protocol, and get yield and transaction fees in exchange. They are here as a buffer for when Hedging Agents do not cover all the collateral brought by users. In short, they are the insuring the protocol against the risk of not having enough HAs positions.  |
| \*\*\*\*[**Collateral Ratio**](https://docs.angle.money/concepts/collateral-ratio) | Ratio between the total value of collateral backing a stablecoin, and the total supply of this stablecoin. The value of the collateral is expressed in the related stablecoin. |
| \*\*\*\*[**Total Covered Amount**](concepts/hedging-agents/#has-covered-amounts)\*\*\*\* | It refers, for a given collateral/stablecoin pair, to the sum of the amount of stablecoins covered by HAs. If there is only one HA covering 2 wETH from the protocol and that entered at a moment where 1 ETH was worth 2000$, then this HA covers 2 \* 2000 = 4000 stablecoins for the protocol, and the total covered amount by HAs for the wETH collateral is 4000 agUSD. |
| \*\*\*\*[**Coverage Ratio**](concepts/hedging-agents/faq-ha.md#what-is-exactly-implied-by-the-coverage-ratio)\*\*\*\* | Ratio between the total covered amount and the target amount that the protocol wants to see covered |
| **Coverage Curve** | A coverage curve refers to a curve that defines the value of transaction fees as a function of the coverage ratio. There are different coverage curves involved in the protocol. Angle Protocol's coverage curves are piecewise linear. For mint fees for example, the higher the coverage ratio is, the more minting fees decrease for stable seekers. |
| üîÆ [**Perpetual Future**](concepts/hedging-agents/#perpetual-futures) | Contract taken by HAs in the protocol, to non-optionally buy a given collateral at an unspecified point in the future. Perpetual futures are financial instruments that try to follow the price of an underlying, and are used by traders to take leveraged positions. More details about such products can be found [here](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-are-perpetual-futures-contracts). |
| **Interests Accumulated** | For a given collateral/stablecoin pair, it refers to the transaction fees and yield from lending that have been reversed in the corresponding pool. Not all the interests accumulated by a pool are distributed to SLPs, a portion directly goes to the protocol's surplus. |
| **agToken** | Tokens representing Angle stablecoins, that can be minted/burnt by swapping with a whitelisted collateral. Tokens start with `ag` followed by the asset to which they are pegged to like agEUR or agUSD. Ag stands for Angle here. |
| **sanToken** | Angle LP Tokens distributed to SLPs bringing collateral to the protocol for a given stablecoin. These tokens are equivalent to [Compound's cTokens](https://compound.finance/docs/ctokens). sanDAI\_EUR are for instance the tokens given to SLPs bringing liquidity to the DAI/agEUR pair. These tokens can be exchanged at any point in time against collateral at an exchange rate that varies in function of the interests accumulated. They are ERC20 tokens that automatically accrue yield. |
| üìà [**Strategy**](concepts/lending.md)\*\*\*\* | Smart contract defining strategies to earn yield from Angle collateral reserves for each stablecoin/collateral pair. They can involve lending to platforms like Aave or Compound, and are inspired by [Yearn](https://docs.yearn.finance/resources/defi-glossary#yvault) vaults strategies.  |
| üíπ [**Debt Ratio**](concepts/lending.md#debt-ratio)\*\*\*\* | For a strategy used in a stablecoin/collateral pair, it refers to the ratio between how much of a collateral is deployed in a strategy and the total amount of collateral tied to the pair the strategy relates to. This total amount includes the amount in the contract corresponding to the pool and the sum of the amounts given to related strategies. Each strategy of the protocol has a target debt ratio. |
| üè≠ [**Keeper**](concepts/keepers.md)\*\*\*\* | A keeper is an individual or a bot that carry out actions that are needed to keep the protocol functioning. They are usually incentivized to perform such actions. Angle Protocol uses different types of keepers. |
| üî± [**Oracle**](concepts/oracles.md)\*\*\*\* | Oracles are third-party services that allow smart contracts within blockchains to receive external data from outside of their ecosystem. They are mainly used to make of cryptocurrency prices available and usable on-chain. The protocol relies on [Chainlink](https://chain.link) and [Uniswap V3 TWAP oracles](https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-v3/). |
