# Angle Documentation Portal

Welcome to the Angle Protocol Documentation Portal! It contains essential info and key links to understand the fundamentals of the Angle protocol.

So grab a coffee ‚òï and enjoy the read!

üìÖ Angle Protocol has been live on the Ethereum mainnet since the 3rd of November 2021 üçÅ.

## Introduction to Angle

Angle is a decentralized stablecoin protocol composed of smart contracts mostly deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.

It can be used to issue stablecoins, called agTokens, that are pegged to a specific value. This means that these tokens are designed to mirror the value of the asset they are pegged to. For example, the agEUR is the EUR-pegged stablecoin issued through Angle Protocol.

Angle has two modules, or set of smart contracts, from which agTokens can be issued or minted: the original [Angle Core module](concepts/overview.md) that was released in November 2021, and the new [Angle Borrowing module](new-module/).

### Core module

Angle Core module relies on three types of agents, that form a balanced ecosystem maintaining agTokens' peg. These agents are users minting and burning the stablecoins, hedging agents covering the protocol collateral from price changes, and standard liquidity providers helping to over-collateralize the protocol.

Learn more in the [core module documentation](concepts/overview.md), and start using it at [app.angle.money](https://app.angle.money).

### Borrowing module

Angle Borrowing module is based on a borrowing mechanism similar to Maker with DAI. Users deposit collateral tokens in the protocol, and can then borrow certain amounts of agTokens from these deposits. This allows them to keep exposure to their tokens deposited in the protocol, while benefitting from additional liquidity in borrowed agTokens.

This module was designed to improve over Maker, Abracadabra, Liquity, and even Euler, Aave and Compound models to allow for capital-efficient interactions with the protocol, to facilitate direct leverage, to optimize borrowers experience and improve liquidation mechanisms.

Learn more in the new [borrowing module documentation](new-module/).

{% hint style="info" %}
Angle Borrowing Module should be deployed in May 2022.
{% endhint %}

### Governance module

Angle also relies on a [Governance module](governance/angle-dao.md) to manage the protocol.

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap

Angle Protocol could be used to issue any stablecoin. and has started on mainnet with agEUR, a Euro stablecoin. Besides creating the first liquid and decentralized Euro stablecoin, the goal of Angle is to create stablecoins for other types of assets.

You can read our [Roadmap blog post](https://blog.angle.money/expanding-beyond-220m-tvl-6475711f458b) from March 3rd 2022 to learn more.

## ‚≠ê [Popularization](resources/popularization/)

If you want to get easier to access or less technical documents about the protocol, you should take a look at this section.

## üïπÔ∏è [Discord](https://discord.gg/3vaHCJw7Mz)

Angle is currently being developed by its Core Team and community. Any help and initiative is more than welcome!

There is a large number of ways to build decentralized stablecoins, and we, at Angle, see the stablecoin space as a large playground where we explore ways to make a cool, sustainable and robust design.

Angle community Discord server is where we collectively organize ourselves to build the best protocol possible, help everyone understand what Angle is about, and most of all have fun playing with DeFi!

## ‚öíÔ∏è [Developers Doc](https://developers.angle.money)

Angle has a technical doc for developers and users to understand how Angle protocol works under the hood and how to build on top of it. Check it out if you want to understand how the protocol's smart contracts are organized.

{% hint style="info" %}
All the protocol's smart contracts have been audited by Chainsecurity and Sigma Prime. You can find the audit reports [here](https://github.com/AngleProtocol/angle-core/tree/main/audits).
