Welcome to the Angle Protocol Documentation Portal! This portal contains some essential info and key links to understand the fundamentals of the Angle protocol.

So grab a coffee ‚òï and enjoy the read!

## Introduction to Angle

### üèÖ Over-Collateralized, Decentralized, Capital-Efficient Stablecoin Protocol

Angle is the first over-collateralized, decentralized and capital-efficient stablecoin protocol. The protocol proposes full convertibility between stable assets and collateral, meaning that it is possible to swap collateral against stable assets, and stable assets against collateral at oracle value: with 1 of collateral, you get 1 of stablecoin and conversely. 

This makes the protocol not only capital efficient but also highly liquid.

### üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap

Angle Protocol could be used to issue any stablecoin, and will start at launch on mainnet with a stable Euro. Besides creating the first liquid Euro stablecoin, the goal of Angle is to create stablecoins for almost all Forex currencies. 

On the roadmap for short after the launch of the stable Euro is among other things a stable USD, a stable CHF and a stable GBP.

### üé® Protocol Design

The protocol involves 3 populations, very common in other DeFi protocols, which all benefit from Angle: 

* ![](.gitbook/assets/emoji-user.png) **Stable Seekers/Holders or Users:** they can swap collateral against stable assets, and conversely swap stable assets against a whitelisted collateral of their choice at oracle value, with no slippage and small transaction fees.
* ![](.gitbook/assets/emoji-ha.png) **Hedging Agents \(HAS\):** who are getting direct leverage in the form of perpetual futures from Angle. They just come to the protocol, choose a pair collateral/stablecoin \(like wETH/USD\) they want to get exposed to, bring some of the chosen collateral and get leveraged with the multiple of their choice on the associated pair. By doing so, they also insure the protocol against the volatility of the collateral brought by stable seekers and thus help the protocol sustain convertibility for users even in case of collateral price drops.
* ![](.gitbook/assets/emoji-slp.png) **Standard Liquidity Providers \(SLP\)** : who lend money to the protocol and in return get part of the transaction fees induced by stable seekers minting and burning, as well as part of the returns made from lending some of the protocol reserves to lending protocols \(like Compound or Aave\). 

In short, Angle matches people who want stability (stable seekers) and people who want volatility (Hedging Agents who get volatility from the collateral brought by stable seekers). Yet, there is not always a perfect match between offer and demand of volatility meaning the protocol's collateral may not be fully covered at all times by Hedging Agents. Standard Liquidity Providers, with the additional capital they bring in, serve as a buffer in this marketplace. 

The protocol is implemented as a set of **smart contracts** on top of the Ethereum blockchain. Smart contracts guarantee safety and do not require a middleman.

## üïπÔ∏è [Discord](https://discord.gg/3vaHCJw7Mz)

Angle is currently being developed by its Core Team and community. Any help and initiative is more than welcome!

There is a large number of ways to build decentralized stablecoins, and we, at Angle, see the stablecoin space as a large playground where we explore ways to make a cool, sustainable and robust design!  

Angle community Discord server is where we collectively organize ourselves to build the best protocol possible, help everyone understand what Angle is about, and most of all have fun playing with DeFi!
