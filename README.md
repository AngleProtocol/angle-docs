## Introduction to Angle

### üèÖ Over-Collateralized, Decentralized, and Capital-Efficient Stablecoin Protocol

Angle is the first over-collateralized, decentralized and capital-efficient stablecoin protocol. It offers full convertibility between stable assets and collateral at oracle value: you can swap 1 of collateral against 1 of stablecoin and conversely.

This makes the protocol both capital efficient and highly liquid.

### üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap

Angle Protocol could be used to issue any stablecoin, and will start on mainnet with a stable Euro. Besides creating the first liquid Euro stablecoin, the goal of Angle is to create stablecoins for other types of assets.

Stable USD, CHF, and KRW should be following EUR after launch.

### üé® Protocol Design

The protocol involves 3 agents, very common in other DeFi protocols, which all bring something to Angle, while benefitting from the protocol:

- **Stable Seekers/Holders, or Users:** they can swap collateral against stable assets, and conversely swap stable assets against a whitelisted collateral of their choice at oracle value, with no slippage and small transaction fees.

- **Hedging Agents (HAs):** they can open on-chain leveraged positions on Angle. They need to bring accepted collateral to the protocol, and are able to take positions on perpetuals futures on the available collateral/stablecoins pairs. By doing so, they insure the protocol against the volatility of the collateral brought by stable seekers. This volatility is transferred to these traders, and the protocol is able to ensure users of the convertibility of the stablecoins they own even in case of collateral price drops.

- **Standard Liquidity Providers (SLP)** : they lend collateral to the protocol in return of a share of minting and burning fees, and of the rewards earned from investing part of the protocol reserves into yield-earning strategies.

In short, Angle matches people who want stability (stable seekers) and people who want volatility (Hedging Agents). Yet, there isn't always a perfect match between supply and demand of volatility, meaning that the protocol's collateral may not be fully covered at all times by Hedging Agents. The additional collateral brought by Standard Liquidity Providers, serve as a buffer in this marketplace.

The protocol is implemented as a set of **smart contracts** on top of the Ethereum blockchain.

## üïπÔ∏è [Discord](https://discord.gg/3vaHCJw7Mz)

Angle is currently being developed by its Core Team and community. Any help and initiative is more than welcome!

There is a large number of ways to build decentralized stablecoins, and we, at Angle, see the stablecoin space as a large playground where we explore ways to make a cool, sustainable and robust design.

Angle community Discord server is where we collectively organize ourselves to build the best protocol possible, help everyone understand what Angle is about, and most of all have fun playing with DeFi!
