## Introduction to Angle

Angle is a decentralized stablecoins protocol composed of smart contracts mostly deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. 

It has three modules, or set of smart contracts: [Angle Core module](/concepts/overview.md), the new [Angle Borrowing module](/new-module/README.md), and the [Angle Governance module](/governance/angle-dao.md). 

### üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap

Angle Protocol could be used to issue any stablecoin. and has started on mainnet with agEUR, a Euro stablecoin. Besides creating the first liquid and decentralized Euro stablecoin, the goal of Angle is to create stablecoins for other types of assets.

Stable CHF, GBP, JPY and KRW should be following agEUR.


## ‚≠ê [Popularization](resources/popularization/)

If you want to get easier to access or less technical documents about the protocol, you should take a look at this section.

## üïπÔ∏è [Discord](https://discord.gg/3vaHCJw7Mz)

Angle is currently being developed by its Core Team and community. Any help and initiative is more than welcome!

There is a large number of ways to build decentralized stablecoins, and we, at Angle, see the stablecoin space as a large playground where we explore ways to make a cool, sustainable and robust design.

Angle community Discord server is where we collectively organize ourselves to build the best protocol possible, help everyone understand what Angle is about, and most of all have fun playing with DeFi!

## ‚öíÔ∏è [Developers Doc](https://developers.angle.money)

Angle has a technical doc for developers and users to understand how Angle protocol works under the hood and how to build on top of it. Check it out if you want to understand how the protocol's smart contracts are organized.

{% hint style="info" %}
All the protocol's smart contracts have been audited by Chainsecurity and Sigma Prime. You can find the audit reports [here](resources/security/).
