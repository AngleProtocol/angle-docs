# Angle Documentation Portal

Welcome to the Angle Protocol Documentation Portal! It contains essential info and key links to understand the fundamentals of the Angle protocol.

So grab a coffee ☕ and enjoy the read!

{% hint style="success" %}
Please join the discussion on the Angle Community [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/67WSSZqBG6) 🕹️, our community is looking forward to helping you use Angle, improve the protocol or even build on top of it!

{% hint style="info" %}
📅 Angle Protocol has been live on the Ethereum mainnet since the 3rd of November 2021 🍁.

## Introduction to Angle

Angle is a decentralized stablecoin protocol composed of smart contracts mostly deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.

It can be used to issue stablecoins, called agTokens, that are pegged to a specific value. This means that these tokens are designed to mirror the value of the asset they are pegged to. For example, the agEUR is the EUR-pegged stablecoin issued through Angle Protocol.

Angle has two modules, or set of smart contracts, from which agTokens can be issued or minted: the original [Angle Core module](concepts/overview.md) that was released in November 2021, and the new [Angle Borrowing module](new-module/).

{% hint style="info" %}
Angle Borrowing Module should be deployed in May 2022.
{% endhint %}

Angle also relies on a [Governance module](governance/angle-dao.md) to manage the protocol.

### 🛣️ Roadmap

Angle Protocol could be used to issue any stablecoin. and has started on mainnet with agEUR, a Euro stablecoin. Besides creating the first liquid and decentralized Euro stablecoin, the goal of Angle is to create stablecoins for other types of assets.

## ⭐ [Popularization](resources/popularization/)

If you want to get easier to access or less technical documents about the protocol, you should take a look at this section.

## 🕹️ [Discord](https://discord.gg/3vaHCJw7Mz)

Angle is currently being developed by its Core Team and community. Any help and initiative is more than welcome!

There is a large number of ways to build decentralized stablecoins, and we, at Angle, see the stablecoin space as a large playground where we explore ways to make a cool, sustainable and robust design.

Angle community Discord server is where we collectively organize ourselves to build the best protocol possible, help everyone understand what Angle is about, and most of all have fun playing with DeFi!

## ⚒️ [Developers Doc](https://developers.angle.money)

Angle has a technical doc for developers and users to understand how Angle protocol works under the hood and how to build on top of it. Check it out if you want to understand how the protocol's smart contracts are organized.

{% hint style="info" %}
All the protocol's smart contracts have been audited by Chainsecurity and Sigma Prime. You can find the audit reports [here](https://github.com/AngleProtocol/angle-core/tree/main/audits).
