## üèÖ Introduction to Angle

Angle is a decentralized, capital efficient and over-collateralized stablecoin protocol composed of smart contracts running on open blockchains. It was launched in November 2021 and you can use it at [app.angle.money](https://app.angle.money).

It can be used to issue stablecoins, called agTokens, designed to mirror the value of an asset they are pegged to.

On top of its stablecoin products, Angle Protocol also offers ways to:

- Trade perpetual futures
- Earn yield from strategies
- Get leverage on a wide range of assets

The protocol consists of several different modules, or sets of smart contracts, from which agTokens can be issued or minted. While Angle launched its first stablecoin agEUR with a single minting module (the [Core module](core-module/overview.md)), a [Borrowing module](borrowing-module/) allowing to borrow Angle stablecoins against deposited collateral has been introduced.

The protocol is also engaged into [Direct Deposit Modules](other/amo.md), also called Algorithmic Market Operations (AMOs), allowing it to boostrap liquidity for agTokens in other protocols.

### Stablecoins

Angle is so far behind two stablecoins:

- agEUR: pegged to the value of the Euro - ‚Ç¨.
- agGOLD: pegged to the value of 1 Troy ounce of Gold (1 oz t = 0.031kg).

{% hint style="info" %}
Not all modules are activated for all Angle stablecoins. [This page](./stablecoins.md) summarizes what is available for which stablecoin.
{% endhint %}

### [Core module](core-module/overview.md)

Angle Core module is deployed on Ethereum mainnet and is used for agEUR only. It relies on three types of agents that form a balanced ecosystem maintaining agEUR's peg (or stability). These agents are [users](core-module/stable-seekers/) minting and burning the stablecoins, [Hedging Agents](core-module/hedging-agents/) covering the protocol collateral from price changes, and [Standard Liquidity Providers](core-module/standard-liquidity-providers/) helping to over-collateralize the protocol in exchange for yield.

### [Borrowing module](borrowing-module/)

Angle Borrowing module is used for all Angle stablecoins, and it is for some of them deployed on multiple EVM compatible networks beyond Ethereum (like Polygon or Optimism). It allows users to deposit collateral and borrow agTokens (debt) against this collateral. It is designed to enable getting leverage on almost any asset through an agToken loan, or to simply let people get access to stablecoins while keeping their exposure to a volatile asset or to a yield-bearing token.

Inspired from more traditional borrowing protocols (like [Maker](https://makerdao.com/en/), [Liquity](https://www.liquity.org), [Aave](https://aave.com), [Compound](https://compound.finance), ...), it comes with its set of new features and improvements which make it overall more capital efficient to use and more borrower friendly.

### Other Aspects

Angle is not limited to these key components. It has notably a complex [bridge infrastructure](other/cross-chain.md) designed to facilitate the cross-chain liquidity of its stablecoins. It also natively supports [flash loans](other/flash-loans.md) for some of its stablecoins.

### üó≥ Governance

Angle is a decentralized protocol governed by [a DAO](governance/angle-dao.md) encapsulating all holders of a governance token called veANGLE. Holders of the token have voting powers to propose and make changes to the underlying code of the Angle Protocol.

## Other Protocol Resources

### üìê [Discord](https://discord.gg/3vaHCJw7Mz)

While Angle was initially created by a team of developers at a company called Angle Labs, Inc, it is progressively decentralising and receives contributions from the external developer community as well as ongoing contributions from Angle Labs.

Angle community Discord server is where the community collectively organizes itself to build the best protocol possible, help everyone understand what Angle is about, and most of all have fun playing with DeFi!

### ‚öíÔ∏è [Developers Doc](https://developers.angle.money)

Angle is an open protocol on which anyone can permissionlessly build or suggest improvements. The protocol relies on an open-source codebase available [on Github](https://github.com/AngleProtocol).

There is a technical doc for developers and advanced users to understand how Angle protocol works under the hood and how to build on top of it.

{% hint style="info" %}
The protocol's smart contracts have undergone several audits by Chainsecurity and Sigma Prime. You can find the different audit reports [here](resources/audits/).

## [Side Products](side-products/README.md)

Angle Labs launched and is currently maintaining Angle Protocol.

Some products developed for the Angle Protocol can also bring value to the wider DeFi userbase. As such, some of them are being released as standalone products so that anyone can benefit from them. This section of the documentation is made to present these side products built by Angle Labs.
