# Angle old cross-chain setup

Angle originally relied on Multichain to bridge tokens. Here is the bridge setup for agEUR and ANGLE before July 2022 and the implementation of LayerZero contracts.

_**Router**: token can be bridged **between** chains with Router support for this token. **Bridge**: token can be bridged only from Ethereum mainnet to the specified chain, and not between chains._

{% hint style="info" %}
Angle related contract addresses across the different sidechains, layer 2s and blockchains Angle is integrated with can be found [here](https://developers.angle.money/protocol-overview/smart-contracts/sidechains-layer2s-contracts).
