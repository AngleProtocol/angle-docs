# ðŸ“” User Guides

The Angle Protocol is available to anyone on the Ethereum mainnet. To make it simpler to use, we have designed an app hosted on IPFS and available at [app.angle.money](https://app.angle.money).

In this guide, you will learn how to play with the app and more particularly to:

* Mint & burn agTokens
* Open, modify, and close a perpetual position
* Deposit collateral into the protocol to get yield in the form of sanTokens
* Stake your tokens to get ANGLE rewards

{% hint style="info" %}
You can also play with the app on the Rinkeby testnet at [rinkeby.angle.money](https://rinkeby.angle.money) by following our guide [here](../resources/rinkeby-testnet/).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The app presented in this guide has been developed by the Angle Core Team. Anyone is welcome to build its app on top of Angle. We will make sure to promote and list any serious front interface of the protocol.
