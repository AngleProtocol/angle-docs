# ‚ô†Ô∏è veANGLE Overview

## Background

veANGLE stands for "voting-escrowed" ANGLE. It is a vesting and yield system based off of Curve‚Äôs veCRV and Frax's veFXS mechanisms. The key property of veANGLE is that it is not a transferable token and it does not trade on liquid markets.

{% hint style="info" %}
The implementation of veANGLE is underway and hasn't been implemented yet. It is expected for January 2022. This docs tries to explain how the model works in practice.
{% endhint %}

## üßæ veANGLE Features

veANGLE can be obtained by locking ANGLE from 1 week to up to 4 years. A smaller balance of veANGLE is obtained when locking for a shorter time. veANGLE balances decrease linearly with time to reflect the reduction in lock-time, approaching 0 veANGLE when lock time is about to end.

veANGLE is useful in three aspects:

- **Voting** on governance proposals and gauges weights
- **Boosting** ANGLE rewards when providing liquidity to a gauge
- **Earning** a share of the interests generated by the protocol

## üòé veANGLE Benefits

The veANGLE system is modular and all-purpose. In the future, it can be evolve in many different ways like by earning additional yield in new places/features, or be treated as a governance token bond rate of sorts.

It is designed to benefit the ANGLE system as a whole by:

- Allocating voting power to long-term holders of ANGLE through veANGLE
- Incentivizing farmers to stake (or lock, both are used equivalently) ANGLE
- Creating a bond-like utility for ANGLE and create a benchmark APR rate for staked ANGLE
