# ‚ô† veANGLE

## Background

veANGLE stands for "voting-escrowed" ANGLE, and is the governance token of the Angle Protocol.

It is a modular and all-purpose vesting and yield system based off of Curve‚Äôs veCRV mechanism. The key property of veANGLE, beyond being a governance token, is that it is non-transferable and it does not trade on liquid markets.

## üßæ veANGLE Features

veANGLE can be obtained by locking ANGLE from 1 week to up to 4 years. A smaller balance of veANGLE is obtained when locking for a shorter time. veANGLE balances decrease linearly with time to reflect the reduction in lock-time, approaching 0 veANGLE when lock time is about to end and ANGLE locked to be released.

As mentioned above, veANGLE is the token used for [voting for governance proposals](../angle-dao.md) and ANGLE emissions through [gauge weights](gauges.md) in the Angle protocol. As such, veANGLE holders are the ones shaping the future of the protocol.

Beyond **voting** on governance proposals and gauge weights, veANGLE is useful in two main aspects:

- [Boosting ANGLE rewards](boost.md) when providing liquidity to a gauge
- Being occasionally redistributed a portion of the earnings the protocol may make through its normal activities, or through other operations (e.g. airdrops) as an incentive for taking part in the governance of the protocol. When rewards are distributed to veANGLE holders, this is done proportionally to the veANGLE balance of each address.
