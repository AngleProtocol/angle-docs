# ‚ô† veANGLE

## Background

veANGLE stands for "voting-escrowed" ANGLE, and is the governance token of the Angle Protocol.

It is a modular and all-purpose vesting and yield system based off of Curve‚Äôs veCRV and Frax's veFXS mechanisms. The key property of veANGLE, beyond being a governance token, is that it is non-transferable and it does not trade on liquid markets.

## üßæ veANGLE Features

veANGLE can be obtained by locking ANGLE from 1 week to up to 4 years. A smaller balance of veANGLE is obtained when locking for a shorter time. veANGLE balances decrease linearly with time to reflect the reduction in lock-time, approaching 0 veANGLE when lock time is about to end and ANGLE locked to be released.

As mentioned above, veANGLE is the token used for [voting for governance proposals](../angle-dao.md) and ANGLE emissions through [gauge weights](gauges.md) in the Angle protocol. As such, veANGLE holders are shaping the future of the protocol.

Beyond **voting** on governance proposals and gauge weights, veANGLE is useful in two main aspects:

* [Boosting ANGLE rewards](boost.md) when providing liquidity to a gauge
* [Earning a share of the revenue](../veangle/interest.md) generated by the protocol
