# ♠️ veANGLE

{% hint style="info" %}
The implementation of veANGLE is underway and hasn't been implemented yet. It is expected for January 2022. This docs tries to explain how the model works in practice.
{% endhint %}

_veANGLE stands for "voting-escrowed" ANGLE_

## veANGLE features

veANGLE can be obtained by locking ANGLE from 1 week to 4 years. A smaller balance of veANGLE is obtained when locking for a shorter time. veANGLE balances decrease linearly with time to reflect the reduction in lock-time.

veANGLE is useful in three aspects:

- **Voting** on improvements proposals and gauges weights
- **Boosting** ANGLE rewards when providing liquidity to a gauge
- **Earning** a share of the interests generated by the protocol
