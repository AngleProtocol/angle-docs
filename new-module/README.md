# ðŸ”­ Borrowing Module Overview

## Introduction

Angle Borrowing Module goal is to help expand the Angle Protocol through another minting mechanism for Angle stablecoins. It is based on a debt mechanism, similar to those used by Maker with DAI, or Abracadbra with MIM. Users can deposit tokens as collateral into the protocol, and borrow agTokens from this deposit depending on specific parameters.

The main advanatages of Angle Borrow module are:

* No need for hedging agents to cover the protocol
* Easier to add new collaterals
* Users can keep exposure to their collateral tokens while using agEUR

These advantages help further expand Angle and its agTokens, both in terms of the stablecoins issued, their volume, and the chains and networks where they can be issued/redeemed. It has been designed to work hand in hand with the current one, and strenghten the Angle Protocol. AgTokens, like agEUR, are fully interoperable between both modules.

## Main Features

### Vaults

With the Angle Borrowing module, users can deposit collateral tokens in a vault and mint (borrow) agTokens from their deposits according to specific parameters. This allow them to keep exposure to their tokens deposited as collateral, while benefitting from disposable liquidity in stablecoins.

More about vaults [here](vaults/).

### Token Reactors

Angle Borrowing module also introduces Token Reactors. They allow users or DAOs to deposit volatile tokens in specific vaults to earn yield on their deposits. This is made possible by minting agTokens that are invested directly in pre-defined strategies earning yield while maintaining a healthy collateral ratio.

### Flash-loans

Another side feature of these smart contracts are the possibility of taking out flash-loans using agTokens.
