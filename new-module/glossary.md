| Term                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| Collateral Ratio (CR)  | The collateral ratio is a ratio that determines the value of the tokens deposited as collateral compared to the value of the outstanding debt. It is expressed as CR = collateral value / debt value, or 150% for example.                                                                                                                                 |
| Collateral Factor (CF) | This is a parameter that gives the minimum collateral ratio possible for each vault type. If the collateral ratio of a vault goes below this value, the vault can get liquidated. The collateral factor is expressed as a fraction. For example, if CF = 2/3, the minimum collateral ratio possible for a position would be minCR = 1 √∑ 2/3 = 3/2 = 150\%. |
| Health Factor (HF)     | The Health Factor is what defines the "health" of a vault. If HF goes below 1, the vault can get liquidated. HF = CR \_ CF. For example, if a vault has a CR of 170% for a CF of 2/3 (minCR of 150%), the Health Factor is at HF = 1.70 - 2/3 = 1.13                                                                                                       |
| Target Health Factor   | The target health factor is the target that determines how much of a vault debt needs to be repaid by a liquidator.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Liquidation            | A liquidation happens when a vault health factor goes below 1. In this case, users that opened the vault will keep their stablecoins but will lose part or all of their collateral. More in the [liquidation](/new-module/vaults/liquidations.md) section.                                                                                                 |
| Stability Fee          | An interest rate paid by agTokens minters for their loans. It is controlled by governance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Dust                   | Dust is the minimum amount of agTokens that can be borrowed from a single vault. This is required to avoid having too small and unealthy debt positions sticking around.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Flash Loan             | Flash Loans are a type of transaction in which agTokens are borrowed and repaid within the same transaction, such that it doesn't require any collateral. More info in the [flash loan](/new-module/flash-loan.md) section.                                                                                                                                |
