The Angle Protocol is currently available to anyone on the Ethereum mainnet, and can be accessed through our app hosted at [app.angle.money](https://app.angle.money/).

From there, users can mint and burn stablecoins, open perpetuals, get yield by depositing collateral, borrow stablecoins, get leverage, lock ANGLE tokens, vote for gauge weights, or simply stake their Angle associated tokens to earn yield.

The following pages contain user guides for all of these use cases:

{% hint style="info" %}
The app presented in our guides has been developed by the Angle Core Team. Anyone is welcome to build its app on top of Angle. We are making sure to promote and list any serious front interface of the protocol.
