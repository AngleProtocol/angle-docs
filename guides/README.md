# ðŸŽ“ Guides

This section contains all guides to interact with the Angle Protocol.

Here are some preliminary guides to onboard you to DeFi and to agEUR, Angle's first stablecoin:

{% content-ref url="newbie.md" %}
[newbie.md](newbie.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="getAgEUR.md" %}
[getAgEUR.md](getAgEUR.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

The Angle Protocol is currently available to anyone on the Ethereum mainnet, through one global application hosted at [app.angle.money](https://app.angle.money/). 

From there, users can mint and burn stablecoins, open perpetuals, get yield by depositing collateral, lock ANGLE tokens, vote for gauge weights, or simply stake their Angle associated tokens to earn yield.

The following pages contain user guides for all of these use cases:

{% content-ref url="app-guides/" %}
[agEUR, deposit, and Perpetuals guide](/guides/app-guides/README.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="veangle-guides/" %}
[ANGLE & veANGLE guides](/guides/veangle-guides/README.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The app presented in our guides have been developed by the Angle Core Team. Anyone is welcome to build its app on top of Angle. We will make sure to promote and list any serious front interface of the protocol.
{% endhint %}

These apps can also be used in test mode on Rinkeby. We have written a guide for this:

{% content-ref url="rinkeby.md" %}
[rinkeby.md](rinkeby.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
