# Get paid in agEUR, receive funds in your bank account

![Untitled](/.gitbook/assets/angle-borrowmodulewp-announcement-light.png)

Thanks to its powerful partners and integrations, agEUR can be used to pay and create invoices, and agEUR can be easily transferred to your home bank account. All of this from almost anywhere in the world, on Ethereum or Polygon!

This can be very useful on two sides: 1) for companies or DAOs wanting to pay their contributors in crypto, and 2) for contributors happy to be paid in crypto but who still need fiat in a bank account for their everyday lives. 

For example, some DAOs might not have a bank account, or just prefer to pay their contributors in crypto. However, these contributors usually need a proper proof of payment (invoice) and a way to transfer those funds to their bank account easily, without taking care of the exchange rate. This is all possible with agEUR: anyone can invoice and get paid in agEUR, and transfer them directly to EUR in their bank account!

Here, we try to show how companies, DAOs, and their contributors can leverage agEUR and Angleâ€™s partners  Request, Mt Pelerin, and Superfluid to do so quickly and in a compliant way. 

## Invoicing in agEUR with Request

### Contributors side

- [Request](https://app.request.finance/)

Request lets users create and send custom invoices to their clients. Users can denominate their invoice in crypto or fiat, and ask to be paid in crypto or fiat. For example, a german or french resident working for an international DAO could label their invoice in EUR, but ask to be paid in agEUR. 

To do that, the person creating the invoice has to specify the wallet address that they want to receive the funds on.

The invoice will look like that ðŸ‘‡

### Crypto Company / DAO side: pay contributor with agEUR from any token

On the company side, once they receive the invoice they can just send the required amount of agEUR to the specified address. If they donâ€™t own agEUR yet, they can go through Angleâ€™s app at [app.angle.money](http://app.angle.money), and add the invoicer address as recipient. Then, they can select **any token they hold**, and use the expert mode to make sure the minimum amount received is that of the invoice.

**In one on-chain transaction, any company or DAO can pay their contributors with any token, almost instantly, and at very low fees.** 

## Withdrawing the agEUR received to a bank account with Mt Pelerin

After the contributors have received their payment from the DAO / company, they can simply withdraw the agEUR from their wallet to EUR in their bank account in one on-chain transaction by using Mt Pelerin. Above a certain amount, users will need to go through a classic KYC process on Mt Pelerinâ€™s mobile application. 

After they are all setup, people will be able to send their cryptos back to their bank account quickly and easily, at the cost and speed of one on-chain transaction. Obviously, users can also keep their agEUR and invest in the different yield opportunities available.

## Angle + Request + Mt Pelerin: New payment solution for people in crypto

In this guide, we discovered a new very efficient way to pay and get paid from crypto to bank account in only two on-chain transactions! Specifically, what we saw here allows: 

- **crypto** **companies** to pay their contributors with agEUR through Angle from the token that they want
- **contributors** to **invoice crypto companies and get paid in agEUR** in a fully compliant way, and
- **contributors** to **transfer agEUR** **to EUR in their bank account** to cover the cost of their everyday lives!

That should be enough to help many companies and DAOs to pay their contributors, and those contributors to receive funds in their local bank account! But there is more ... streaming money incoming ðŸ’¸ðŸ‘‡

## ðŸ’¸Â Go further by streaming those payments with Superfluid ðŸ’¸

Superfluid allows user to **stream tokens on Polygon and xDAI**. Thanks to Angleâ€™s agEUR integration, users can receive their payments not as a one-time transactions, but through **a payment streams** using Superfluid. This allows them to get paid continuously, and not just once at the end of each month. 

To do so, the payer will have to wrap their agEUR into agEURx. Once they want to withdraw the received agEURx, they can just unwrap them, and use Mt Pelerin to send EUR back to their bank account, or find a good yield opportunity on Polygon.
