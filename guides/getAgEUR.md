# How to get agEUR

agEUR is a **EUR-pegged stablecoin**, meaning that it's built to mirror the value of the EUR. The objective behind stablecoins is to create tokens that hold their value against some tangible references, like central bank currencies, and make them available on decentralized and open blockchains such as Ethereum.

If you are new to crypto, follow our [guide for new crypto users](./newbie.md). Then, keep reading here to see how you can get agEUR on the blockchain, or directly from money at the bank.

## ðŸ”Ž TL;DR

There are multiple ways to get agEUR:

- mint new agEUR directly from the [Angle App](https://app.angle.money/) against your tokens
- swap ETH for agEUR on [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org) or any DEX aggregator on Ethereum mainnet or on any supported chain.
- buy agEUR with credit card from one of our on-ramp partners like [Wert.io](https://widget.wert.io/01FPZ4G1VMZ67MGC83NADPB0F8/redirect/?commodity=agEUR&commodities=agEUR,agEUR%3Aethereum)

## Buying agEUR

**With an on-ramp solution** If you're not familiar with Ethereum, you can create a wallet with [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com) or [Metamask](https://metamask.io) and go through our on-ramp partner at [wert.io](https://widget.wert.io/01FPZ4G1VMZ67MGC83NADPB0F8/redirect/?commodity=agEUR&commodities=agEUR,agEUR%3Aethereum) to buy agEUR on Ethereum or Polygon.

**On a decentralized exchange** If you already have a wallet with some ETH, you can buy agEUR directly on the blockchain through Uniswap or any DEX aggregator. The best way to buy agEUR on Ethereum mainnet is to swap from ETH or from USDC on UniswapV3. agEUR is avalaible with deep liquidity on exchanges on multiple chains besides Ethereum (Solana, Fantom, Polygon).
