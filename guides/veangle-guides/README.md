# ðŸ“— Governance Guides

Angle Protocol is governed by veANGLE holders. While vote on governance proposals is for the moment taking place off-chain [on Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/anglegovernance.eth), the features of the veANGLE system, including **locking ANGLE**, **interest distribution**, and **voting on gauge rewards** may be difficult to grasp and handle.

In the following pages, we detail how to benefit from each of the veANGLE features and vote on Angle, as well as how to use your participation in the Angle ecosystem to earn ANGLE tokens as well as other incentives.

You can access all the veANGLE features from the [Angle App](https://app.angle.money/#/lock).
