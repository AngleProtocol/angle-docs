# Buying ANGLE

ANGLE tokens can be bought directly from the Angle App with any tokens.

## Best possible price

We integrated with DEX aggregator [1inch](https://app.1inch.io/#/1/swap/ETH/ANGLE) to fetch the best possible prices to buy ANGLE. 1inch compares different options to buy ANGLE. We improved on the basic 1inch integration by checking all routes related to ANGLE, and making sure to give you the best output.

## Step-by-step guide

1. Choose the token you want to buy ANGLE with, or paste its address in the search bar.
2. You will see an estimation of the quantity of ANGLE you should receive.
3. Below, there are a number of information like the minimum amount of tokens received, the exchange rate, the price impact, and the transaction fee. There is also an `Expert Mode` toggle that lets you set your slippage tolerance (detailed below).
4. Once everything looks fine, you will have to 1) approve your tokens and 2) send the transaction through your wallet.

## Choosing slippage tolerance

When buying ANGLE on the app, you can set the maximal slippage (price impact) you want to tolerate. This is the maximum price change you are willing to accept between the price displayed at the beginning of the transaction, and the actual price at which the transaction is executed.

If the price moves too much before your transaction happens compared to your slippage, the transaction will revert and you will get bak your funds.
