# Earning ANGLE

ANGLE tokens are issued every week and distributed to different stakeholders of the Angle ecosystem.

To take advantage of that, you can among other things [deposit sanTokens](https://app.angle.money/#/deposit), [open long positions](https://app.angle.money/#/perpetuals) on the protocol, or deposit LP (liquidity providers) tokens.

You can find all the available pools and farms in the [Earn page](https://app.angle.money/#/earn) of the app.

After staking your tokens or taking any action that gives you the rights to these tokens (like opening a perpetual), you will begin automatically accumulating ANGLE tokens.

## Claiming ANGLE

You have multiple options when claiming your ANGLE tokens:

- Claim from multiple Boosted and Perpetuals gauges in **one transaction** by clicking on the `Claim Rewards` button on the right. You will be able to select/unselect the gauges you want to claim rewards from. When using this modal, you can:
  - **`Claim ANGLE`**: this will claim your ANGLE rewards from all the selected gauges in one transaction.
  - **`Claim and Lock ANGLE`**: this will claim your ANGLE rewards from all the selected gauges in one transaction **and** lock them into your existing ANGLE lock. This will increase your veANGLE balance and won't affect your lock expiration date. _NB: this is only possible if you already have ANGLE locked. You can lock ANGLE_ [_here_](https://app.angle.money/#/lock)_._&#x20;
