# üè¶ agEUR as a treasury asset

As described [here](ageur-power-usecase.md), agEUR can be used by companies and DAOs to pay their contributors. In this guide, we show how they can benefit from using agEUR as a treasury asset.

Angle‚Äôs agEUR can also be used by companies and DAOs as a treasury asset to diversify holdings and earn yield on top of EUR.

Most DAOs or companies with crypto treasuries hold a mix of BTC, ETH, and USD stablecoins. With agEUR, they have a way to diversify those reserves into one of the biggest fiat currency, through a decentralized stablecoin that has deep on-chain liquidity and is integrated with the best DeFi protocols.

Holding agEUR in a treasury allows to:

* Diversify holdings
* Earn yield on EUR
* Keep enough capital to pay your European contributors, while avoiding negative bank interest on it

{% hint style="info" %}
agEUR is a supported asset on Gnosis Safe and the Angle App integrates with Gnosis as well.

## Getting agEUR in your treasury

agEUR can be minted directly from Angle at [app.angle.money](https://app.angle/money/), or bought from a DEX, a DEX aggregator, or from one of our [on-ramp partners](getAgEUR.md#buying-ageur-with-credit-card-or-bank-transfer). If you are looking to buy an important amount of agEUR, the best place would be directly on Angle where there is no slippage.

You can find more details in the [Get agEUR page](getAgEUR.md) of this documentation.

## Earning yield on your agEUR

Once you hold agEUR, there are multiple ways to earn yield on top of it.

### Deposit on Euler

[Euler](https://www.euler.finance) is a lending market with a well researched risk framework and improved liquidations.

Yield for agEUR deposits on Euler is currently ranging between 2% and 3%. Tokens can just be deposited on [app.euler.finance](https://app.euler.finance), and they will start earning interest.

### Deposit on Curve and stake on Convex

Another option is to deposit agEUR in the [Curve 3EUR](https://curve.fi/factory/66/deposit) pool (agEUR+EURs+EURt), and then deposit the Curve LP tokens on [Convex](https://www.convexfinance.com/stake) for CVX and CRV rewards.

This opportunity usually generates higher yield but it is reserved for more advanced users.

### Other yield opportunities

#### Aave on Polygon

agEUR is also available on Polygon, where it can be deposited on Aave lending market to earn yield.

#### LP on incentivized agEUR/token pools

Some agEUR pools are incentivized with ANGLE token rewards and can yield interesting APRs, like agEUR/ETH at . 30%, or agEUR/USDC at \~10%.

More generally, all ANGLE-related yield opportunities can be accessed through the [DAO App incentives](https://dao.angle.money/#/stake) page.

## Paying contributor with agEUR

Companies with agEUR in their treasury can also pay very easily their contributors in a transparent and compliant way. In just two on-chain transactions, their contributors can receive EUR in their bank account.

All the steps are detailed on the [agEUR Power Use Case](ageur-power-usecase.md) page.
