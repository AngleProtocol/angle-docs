# ðŸ“” App Guides

This section contains guides to interact through [app.angle.money](https://app.angle.money) with the main features of the different modules of the Angle protocol.

You will learn how to play with the app and more particularly to:

- Buy and sell agEUR: `Swap`
- Borrow agEUR or get leverage on the crypto assets of your choice using the Borrowing module: `Borrow / Leverage`
- Open, modify, and close a perpetual position: `Trade Perpetuals`
- Deposit collateral into the protocol to get yield in the form of sanTokens: `Deposit / SLP`

## UI tour

The Angle App contains most of the features related to the protocol. Pages can be accessed from the sidebar on the left under three main sections: **agTokens**, **Protocol**, and **ANGLE**. External partners can also be found in the **More** section, and everything you need to know about the protocol is under **Info** at the bottom.

### agTokens

Under the **Swap** tab, you can buy or sell agEUR from multiple tokens.

{% content-ref url="/guides/app-guides/getageur.md" %}
[Swap - Get agEUR](/guides/app-guides/getageur.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

In the **Borrow / Leverage** one, you can deposit collateral to be allowed to borrow agEUR on top of your deposits. You can also use this mechanism to get leverage on the tokens deposited directly within the Angle app in one transaction.

{% content-ref url="borrow-ageur.md" %}
[Borrow / Leverage](borrow-ageur.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Protocol

In the protocol section, you can **deposit** tokens to earn yield, and **trade** perpetuals on forex or crypto.

{% content-ref url="slp-pools.md" %}
[Deposit / SLP](slp-pools.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="ha-positions.md" %}
[Trade Perpetuals](ha-positions.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### ANGLE

Everything related to ANGLE & veANGLE can be found in the ANGLE section.

You can **lock** ANGLE to get veANGLE, vote on rewards distribution (**gauge** tab), stake their funds to **earn** ANGLE tokens, and **buy** ANGLE with any tokens directly from the same UI!

Governance-related guides can be found in the [Governance guides](../veangle-guides/).
