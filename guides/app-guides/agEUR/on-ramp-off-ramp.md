# ðŸ’³ Using on & off ramp services for agEUR

## Buying agEUR with credit card or bank transfer

agEUR is supported by a wide range of on-ramp partners which make it accessible from a simple credit card payment or bank transfer. Our on/off-ramp partners include:

- Mt Pelerin
- Transak
- Wert.io

All of them are accessible from the main Angle interface on the [On-ramp / off-ramp](https://app.angle.money/#/ramp) page.

The only thing you need beyond a credit card is a wallet (like [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com) or [Metamask](https://metamask.io)) to receive the agEUR the on-ramp provider will send you.

These providers usually let you receive the agEUR on the Ethereum or Polygon network.
