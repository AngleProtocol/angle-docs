# ðŸ’± Swap - Buy Angle stablecoins

If you are new to crypto, follow our [guide for new crypto users](../../newbie.md) first. Otherwise, keep reading here to see how you can get agEUR and other Angle stablecoins directly from Angle. If you want to buy agEUR with credit card or bank transfer, you can refer to [this guide](./on-ramp-off-ramp.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
The swap page functionalities are the same whether you're coming it to it for agEUR or another stablecoin.
{% endhint %}

## Buying

The app Swap page integrates 1inch (which integrates agEUR's native mint & burn mechanism on Ethereum) to provide the best rates to buy Angle stablecoins.

Here are the steps to buy from Angle:

1. Go to the [Swap page](https://app.angle.money/swap) of the app.
2. Select network on which you want to get the stablecoin. Currently, Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon and Avalanche are supported.
3. Select the stablecoin you want to buy
4. Select the token you want to buy the stablecoin with. You can also copy any token's address you like.
5. Enter the amounts you want.
6. The app integrates 1inch and will automatically fetch the best rates for you in the background.
7. Approve your tokens. More precisely, to interact with Angle (and any other DeFi protocol), you need to approve (this is a transaction which costs ETH) or give permissions (signature) for the tokens you want to spend. This depends on the tokens used and not on the protocol.
8. Once the permission has been signed or the approval transaction has been executed, you can confirm the transaction to buy the stablecoin.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can refresh the rates by clicking on the circled arrow on the top right of the inputs.

## Selling

Selling an Angle stablecoin through the Swap page works exactly in the opposite way. Click on the arrow between the two inputs to put the stablecoin (e.g agEUR) as `From` token. You can then select the token you want to swap the stablecoin for, enter an amount and confirm your transaction.
