# ðŸ’° Buying ANGLE

## Step-by-step guide

1. Go to the [buy page](https://app.angle.money/#/buy) of the app
1. Choose the token you want to buy ANGLE with, or paste its address in the search bar.
1. You will see an estimation of the quantity of ANGLE you should receive, from the DEX aggregator [1inch](https://app.1inch.io/#/1/swap/ETH/ANGLE) which compares the different options to buy ANGLE.
1. Below, there are a number of information like the minimum amount of tokens received, the exchange rate, the price impact, and the transaction fee. There is also an `Expert Mode` toggle that lets you set your slippage tolerance (detailed below).
1. Once everything looks fine, you will have to 1) approve your tokens and 2) send the transaction through your wallet.

## Choosing slippage tolerance

When buying ANGLE on the app, you can set the maximal slippage (price impact) you want to tolerate. This is the maximum price change you are willing to accept between the price displayed at the beginning of the transaction, and the actual price at which the transaction is executed.

If the price moves too much before your transaction happens compared to your slippage, the transaction will revert and you will get bak your funds.
