# Lock ANGLE into veANGLE

ANGLE holders can lock their tokens between 1 week and 4 years to obtain veANGLE, granting them voting power in our governance system, boost on rewards for some staking contracts, and a share of the interest generated by the protocol.

Before locking ANGLE, make sure you read all the details about veANGLE and locking [here](../../governance/veANGLE/). Remember that the veANGLE tokens you'll get are non-transferable (you won't be able to sell it) and that you will not be able to get back your ANGLE tokens during the period for which you have locked them.

If you are new to DeFi, you may also want to check out [this onboarding guide](../newbie.md) we have made. Most important thing to have in mind is that to get veANGLE, you need ANGLE in your wallet as well as ETH to pay for the Ethereum network transaction fees.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can get ANGLE tokens by buying them from any other crypto-asset on [this page](https://app.angle.money/#/buy) of the app.
{% endhint %}

ANGLE tokens can be locked on the [Lock page](https://app.angle.money/#/lock).

## Creating a lock

To create a lock, head over to the bottom right corner of the screen. There, an expiration date and quantity of tokens need to be specified.

The more ANGLE you lock and the longer you lock them, the bigger your veANGLE balance will be, and hence the bigger your influence in the Angle protocol.

Then, two transactions are needed:

1. First transaction is to approve the contract. This transaction is needed to allow the veANGLE contract to use your ANGLE tokens.
2. Second transaction is to create the lock with the specified amount of tokens and the desired duration.

After executing this, you'll be owning veANGLE tokens. Your veANGLE balance will decrease over time to go to 0 when your lock is expired.

{% hint style="info" %}
You will only be able to create a lock with your address once. Once an address initiates a lock, it can only increase the lock expiration, or add tokens to the lock.
{% endhint %}

## Increasing the lock or adding tokens

Once your lock has been created, to extend the lock expiration or add tokens, just click on one of the two buttons and choose a new expiration date (up to 4 years from now) or a quantity of tokens to add.

## Locking ANGLE before staking

One particularity of the gauge system is that the staking contracts canâ€™t fetch the veANGLE balance of stakers in real time. Therefore, this information needs to be updated once in a while by the staking contracts. This happens at checkpoints, when users stake, unstake, or claim rewards from the gauge.

In practice, this means that itâ€™s better to lock ANGLE into veANGLE (or increase/extending your lock) **before staking** in order for the boost to be applied directly. If not, clamining a tiny amount of rewards **after** staking will be needed to apply the boost.

To compute the balance of veANGLE needed to get the max boost on rewards depending on the quantity of tokens staked, there is a calculator on the [Lock page](https://app.angle.money/#/lock).

## Expired lock

Once your lock is expired, to get your ANGLE tokens back from the lock, you need to execute a transaction. This can be done by clicking on the `Withdraw ANGLE` button that'll be visible at this time on the [lock page](https://app.angle.money/#/lock) of the app.

## Claiming interest

Every week, a share of the interest generated by the protocol is redistributed with veANGLE holders. These interest are currently being distributed in the form of sanUSDC_EUR tokens, earning yield from the protocol. They can always be redeemed for USDC from the protocol.

These interest can be claimed with a transaction initiated by clicking on the `Claim Interest` button on the bottom right corner of the above screnshot. As a veANGLE holder, you also have the options to `Claim and Stake`, and `Claim and Mint agEUR`.

### Claim interest and Stake

This claims the sanUSDC_EUR and stake them directly in the associated gauge in the same transaction to start earning ANGLE rewards. You can check you staked sanUSDC_EUR in the App [Earn page](https://app.angle.money/#/earn).

### Claim interest and Mint agEUR

This claims the sanUSDC_EUR and uses them to mint agEUR in the protocol. You will end up receiving agEUR in your wallet. The **fees** and **minimum amount of agEUR received** are displayed in the Show mint info toggle.
