# Leverage on crypto with agEUR

The Angle Borrowing module can be used to get leverage on crypto deposited as collateral with agEUR, directly from the [Angle App](https://app.angle.money/#/borrow). 

This works by borrowing agEUR, swapping them into the token originally deposited as collateral, and depositing this token back into the vault. You can learn more about the mechanism [here](/borrowing-module/vaults/README.md#leveraging-collateral-exposure). 

Note that at the difference of simple borrowing, leveraging increases your exposure to the collateral token and make the overall position more risky.  

## How to get leverage

Here are the steps to get leverage with Angle: 
1. Select your vault and the `Leverage` action. 
2. Input the amount of collateral that you want to deposit
3. Input the amount of additional exposure you want on the collateral token, or choose your leverage from the slider.
4. Make sure to double check the summary on the screen, and click on `Add step` to move on to the final section and finalize the transaction.
