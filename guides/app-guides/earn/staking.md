# üçÄ Earning ANGLE and other rewards

ANGLE tokens are issued every week and distributed to different stakeholders of the Angle ecosystem.

The [Earn page](https://app.angle.money/earn) of the app lists all the pools and farms where it is possible to earn ANGLE tokens, and more generally any other yield opportunities linked to Angle.

This is also where you can deposit tokens accepted as collateral in the Core module to act as an [SLP](/core-module/standard-liquidity-providers/README.md).

The protocol incentivizes Uniswap V3 Liquidity Providers of some specific pools. This page is where Uniswap Liquidity Providers can track opportunities and claim their rewards.

For more details on how Uniswap V3 Liquidity Providers can be rewarded with ANGLE tokens, check [this guide](/guides/other/univ3-lp.md).
{% endhint %}

## Deposit, stake, or withdraw tokens as a SLP

In the Earn page, tokens can be deposited to earn yield and over-collateralize agEUR through its Core module. These funds are invested into DeFi strategies, and can be staked to earn additional ANGLE rewards.

When on the Earn page, click on the SanTokens anchor and select your pool. Then, you can deposit, stake, or withdraw your funds by selecting the token you want to use.

## Claiming ANGLE tokens

You have multiple options to claiming your ANGLE tokens:

- Claim from multiple gauges in **one transaction** by clicking on the `Claim Rewards` button on the right. When using this modal, you can select/unselect the gauges you want to claim rewards from and then:
  - **`Claim ANGLE`**: this claims your ANGLE rewards from all the selected gauges (except the UniswapV3 related ones) in one transaction.
  - **`Claim and Lock ANGLE`**: this claims your ANGLE rewards from all the selected gauges (except the UniswapV3-related ones) in one transaction **and** lock them into your existing ANGLE lock. This increases your veANGLE balance and doesn't affect your lock expiration date. _NB: this is only possible if you already have ANGLE locked. You can lock ANGLE [here](https://app.angle.money/lock)._
