# Transmuter Governance Considerations

The main functionalities of the Transmuter system can work autonomously with no governance involved, but the system is not a governance-free system.

In the case of Angle use case though, the protocol governance must be involved to add new collateral assets, to adjust the fee parameters that determine the target and maximum exposures to each asset, to change the different oracle parameters, to modify the settings of the redemption curve, or to simply pause minting or burning from an asset.
