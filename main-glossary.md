| Module | A set of smart contracts interacting together for a specific use case.          |
| Core Module | The first set of smart contracts of the Angle Protocol deployed in November 2021 and used to mint and burn agTokens in a capital-efficient and over-collateralized way. More information [here](/concepts/overview.md).   |

| Governance | The group of stakeholders in the Angle Protocol that can decide the upgrades and improvements that should be made to the protocol. Currently, the Angle Governance is made up of the veANGLE holders.   |
| ANGLE | The original governance token of the Angle Protocol. It has been upgraded to a ve (voting-escrowed) model to align the motivations of the stakeholders with the protocol. More info in the [ANGLE page](/governance/angle-token.md).   |
