Flash-loans are now possible with agTokens!

## What are flash loans?

They are a type of loans that allow to borrow and repay tokens in one transaction. Thanks to that, the entity taking out the loan don't need to put down any collateral, as the lender is guaranteed to be paid back if the transaction is executed. This also allows them to borrow/mint huge amounts of agTokens through flash-loans.
