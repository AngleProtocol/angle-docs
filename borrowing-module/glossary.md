| Term                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| Collateral Ratio (CR)   | The collateral ratio is a ratio that determines the value of the tokens deposited as collateral compared to the value of the outstanding debt. It is expressed as CR = collateral value / debt value, or 150% for example.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Loan-to-value (LTV)     | The loan to value is the maximum amount of stablecoins debt compared with the collateral deposited in the vault. For example, if wETH's LTV is at 80%, a user depositing 1,000 â‚¬ worth of wETH can borrow up to 800 agEUR.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Collateral Factor (CF)  | This is a parameter that gives the minimum collateral ratio possible for each vault type. If the collateral ratio of a vault goes below this value, the vault can get liquidated. The collateral factor is expressed as a fraction. For example, if CF = 2/3, the minimum collateral ratio possible for a position would be minCR = 1 Ã· 2/3 = 3/2 = 150\%.                                             |
| Health Factor (HF)      | The Health Factor is what defines the "health" of a vault. If HF goes below 1, the vault can get liquidated. HF = CR x CF. For example, if a vault has a CR of 170% for a CF of 2/3 (minCR of 150%), the Health Factor is at HF = 1.70 x 2/3 = 1.13.13                                                                                                                                                 |
| Target Health Factor    | The target health factor is the target that determines how much of a vault debt needs to be repaid by a liquidator.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Liquidation             | A liquidation happens when a vault health factor goes below 1. In this case, users that opened the vault keep their stablecoins but lose part or all of their collateral. More in the [liquidation](/borrowing-module/vaults/liquidations.md) section.                                                                                                                                                 |
| Stability Fee           | An interest rate paid by agTokens minters for their loans. It is controlled by governance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Dust                    | Dust is the minimum amount of agTokens that can be borrowed from a single vault. This is required to avoid having too small and unealthy debt positions sticking around. There is another parameter called the `dustLiquidation` parameter which refers to the minimum amount of debt below which if a position gets liquidated, it will have its full debt repaid (rather than only a portion of it). |
| `VaultManager` contract | A `VaultManager` contract is a contract that manages all vaults for a specific collateral type with the same parameters (collateral factor, dust amount, fees, ...).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
