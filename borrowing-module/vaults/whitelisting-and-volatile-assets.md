# ü§ù Whitelisting and volatile assets

## Whitelisting Addresses

While there will be one contract per vault type handling positions, some collateral types can be made permissioned meaning that only some pre-defined addresses would be allowed to borrow from it.

This could serve different use cases.

### For specific collateral types

The whitelisting of addresses can be used to deploy specific collateral types (like real-world assets for example). In this case, governance may need to keep tight control on who can borrow to avoid exploits.

### For specific entities

A DAO or a company could have a significant amount of a specific token. With this whitelisting feature, the protocol would build a tailored vault type, with specific parameters and potentially pre-defined spending conditions of the loan.

Let's say that a company has ETH in reserves, and wants to provide liquidity in the agEUR/USDC Uniswap V3 pool. In this case, we could imagine a specific vault type that could only use the borrowed funds to provide liquidity to the UniV3 agEUR/USDC pool with a pre-defined ratio. In this case, this vault could benefit from a higher collateral factor or a lower stability fee for example.

We can also imagine the case of a DAO with governance tokens reserves. In this case, the DAO might want to benefit from the use of a stablecoin for its operations, or to invest it in pre-defined strategies. The protocol would be able to build a tailored vault, that would allow to borrow agEUR from this governance token, but at a lower collateral factor.
