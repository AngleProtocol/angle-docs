# Deprecated documentation

This section keeps details of some documentation that used to be relevant for Angle.

As any protocol, Angle evolves. Better ways to make agents within the protocol interact with each other can be found, and as such it is important to allow the protocol to evolve.

Since launch on November 3rd 2021, new staking contracts have for instance been launched as well as new ways to distribute ANGLE tokens across the different staking contracts.

At launch, the Core Team wanted to launch a bonding curve to sell ANGLE tokens, but soon realized that it was not the best idea as better models like Olympus Pro exist. For the record, we believe it's important to keep here documentation that was written for these contracts as others may find it useful for their own uses.
