# Staking Pools

You can stake your sanTokens and agTokens in the staking page to earn ANGLE rewards.

The rewards schedule can be consulted here. The weights between pools will be updated weekly by governance.

On the main Staking page, you can choose to `Stake` your tokens, `Claim` your rewards, or `Unstake` your tokens (which will claim rewards simultaneously).

You need to have either agTokens or sanTokens to be able to stake with Angle.

To **stake**, you simply need to click on the `Staking` button and enter the amount of tokens you want to stake.

To **claim** your rewards, click on the `Claim` button on the main Staking page. This will prompt you the transaction to claim all your rewards.

To **unstake** your tokens, you can click on the `Unstake` button. This will redirect you to another page asking you for the number of tokens you want to unstake.
