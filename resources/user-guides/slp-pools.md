# Standard Liquidity Providers Pools

Each collateral/stablecoin pair on Angle has a dedicated pool, which funds are invested into yearn-like strategies to put the protocol capital to work and earn interests. You can deposit your collateral on the pools of your choice. Even though some pools have the same tokens, they don't necessarily have the same APY. The reason why is explained in the [User FAQ](../app-faq.md).

1. Choose the pool you would like to deposit your tokens in and click on `Deposit`.
2. On the deposit page, enter the amount of tokens you want to put in the pool and confirm the transaction.
3. You will receive sanTokens in exchange, which represent your liquidity in the pool and automatically accrue interest.
4. To withdraw, your funds just click on the `Withdraw` button on the Pools page, and input the number of sanTokens you want to burn.
