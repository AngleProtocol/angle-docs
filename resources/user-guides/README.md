Once you are connected to Rinkeby, you can get testnet ETH, USDC and DAI by following the instructions below (from [Teller guide](https://teller.gitbook.io/teller-1/testing-guide/getting-testnet-tokens-rinkeby)):

1. Go to your preferred social media platform, and create a public tweet or post with your Ethereum wallet address.

3. Then, if you want to get USDC or DAI, go to https://app.compound.finance/, and connect with Metamask on Rinkeby. If you click on any Supply Markets coin, you will see a FAUCET button at the bottom.
