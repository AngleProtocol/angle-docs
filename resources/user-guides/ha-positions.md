# Opening Leveraged Positions on Angle

## Opening

2. Then, similarly to an isolated-margin exchange, they need to select the amount of collateral they will lock in Angle as margin for their position.
3. After that, they can select their leverage or position size. Leverage in Angle is computed as $(margin + position Size)/margin$.
4. The collateral/stablecoin exchange rate and fee are displayed.
5. Users need to approve their collateral.
6. Clicking the `Open position` button will send the margin to the protocol and open the leveraged position.

Be careful, when opening a position, updating and closing will be locked for an hour. More info [here](../user-faq.md).

## Updating

If you have some open positions, you might want to add or remove margin to some of them. Doing so will update your leverage and change your liquidation price. There is no fee for updating margin.

1. On the HA positions page, click on the `Update` button.
2. Enter an amount of collateral to add or remove from your position, or change its leverage. You can remove collateral up to reaching the max leverage on your position (x10).
3. You will find current and updated info about your position.
4. Then, just confirm the transaction and it will send/withdraw the amount of collateral that was specified.
5. After the transaction is confirmed, you can go back to the Positions page to see your updated position.

## Closing

1. To close a position, click on the `Close` button of the positions you would like to close.
2. Your position opening and current prices, as well as the total cash out amount are displayed.
3. Click on the `Close` button to confirm the transaction and receive the cash out amount (margin Â± PnL).
