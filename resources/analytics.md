# ðŸ“Š Angle analytics 

Getting insights about a protocol can be very challenging without a dedicated and up-to-date analytics. This is why we built one from the start with most of the important information users could need about Angle. 

## Main protocol analytics

The official Angle analytics is available at [analytics.angle.money](https://analytics.angle.money/). General data about the protocol, and specific information about governance, each smart contract modules, and the different stablecoins can be found there. 

## Community Dune dashboards

Some community members have also built dedicated Dune dashboards: 
- [Angle Dashboard](https://dune.com/SebVentures/Angle-Dashboard) from SebVentures, with general information about the protocol. 
- [veANGLE](https://dune.com/tuta/veANGLE-data) from tuta, with specific information about veANGLE. 
- [Angle Gauges Votes](https://dune.com/tuta/Angle-Gauges-Votes) from tuta, with specific information about votes on Angle gauges and ANGLE distribution. 
- [Angle Knowledge NFT](https://dune.com/0xroll/Angle-Protocol-Knowledge-NFT) from OxRoll, with data about the NFT distributed to users that completed the Angle Knowledge quizz.
