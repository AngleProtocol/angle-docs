# ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º agEUR

## How it works

agEUR is a EUR-pegged stablecoin, meaning that it is made to hold a value of 1 EUR. The objective behind stablecoins is to create tokens that hold their value against some tangible references, like central bank currencies, and make them available on decentralized and open blockchains such as Ethereum.

agEUR can be minted or burned on the Ethereum blockchain at [app.angle.money](https://app.angle.money), and bridged to be used in other compatible networks (see the [Mulitchain Angle page](../sidechains/README.md)).
