# ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º agEUR

## How does it work?

agEUR is a EUR-pegged stablecoin, meaning that it is made to hold a value of 1 EUR. The objective behind stablecoins is to create tokens that hold their value against some tangible references, like central bank currencies, and make them available on decentralized and open blockchains such as Ethereum.

agEUR can be minted on the Ethereum blockchain at [app.angle.money](https://app.angle.money), and bridged to be used in other compatible networks (see the [Mulitchain Angle page](../sidechains/)). It can be used to hold EUR value on the blockchain directly

More information on the functioning of agEUR in the [Stable Seeker and Holders](https://docs.angle.money/concepts/stable-seekers) page.

## Buying agEUR

### On the blockchain

**With an on-ramp solution** If you're not familiar with Ethereum, you can create a wallet with [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com) or [Metamask](https://metamask.io) and go through our on-ramp partner at [wert.io](https://widget.wert.io/01FPZ4G1VMZ67MGC83NADPB0F8/redirect/?commodity=agEUR\&commodities=agEUR,agEUR%3Aethereum) to buy agEUR on Ethereum or Polygon.

**On a decentralized exchange** If you already have a wallet with some ETH, you can buy agEUR directly on the blockchain through Uniswap or any DEx aggregator.

### On an exchange

Currently, agEUR is available on Gate.io, Poloniex, and AEX. We are working hard to make it available on more exchanges. If you know anyone that might be able to help us list agEUR, reach out in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/fNZmqdrM2F)!
