# ‚≠ê Popularization

Angle is a complex protocol but its vision remains clear: build tools and money legos to onboard a billion users to DeFi. To succeed in this, not only is making reliable stablecoins important but education becomes even more crucial.

The idea with this page is to gather in a single place all the educational/popularization content about the protocol and DeFi.

{% hint style="success" %}
Achieving this requires more than the implication of a dedicated Core Team and so any help is welcome to keep populating and producing content that will help everyone understand what DeFi stands for and how Angle can fit in that vision. The place to suggest ideas is as always Angle Community [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/67WSSZqBG6) üïπÔ∏è
