# Liquidity Providers Guide

As a liquidity provider, you can now customize your position to optimize your returns on Uniswap V3 according to how the incentivizors set up the distribution formula.

The main choices for a LP are:

- how tight should the positionâ€™s range be
- what should the split between the two tokens be

For example, a tight range will virtually provide more liquidity and earn more fees and ANGLE rewards. However, it has more chance to become out-of-range and suffer from impermanent loss.

All pools using Merkl are listed at merkl.angle.money. There are links to Uniswap V3 and the supported liquidity managers for LPs to deposit their funds. If you are using a liquidity manager, be careful to understand how they rebalance the liquidity they manage.

Once liquidity is being provided, no additional steps are required to start receiving your rewards, and they can all be claimed directly from the Merkl page.

Check this page to find out whether the liquidity manager you're using is supported for the chain on which you are
