# ðŸ¥¨ Merkl

Merkl is a mechanism to incentivize Uniswap V3-type liquidity positions in a flexible and efficient way. It is built and maintained by Angle Labs, but is separate from the Angle Protocol.

In essence, Merkl is a platform where Liquidity Providers (LPs) on Uniswap V3 and other types of AMMs with concentrated liquidity can receive compensation from people incentivizing liquidity (incentivizors) on one or several pools.

Incentivizors enjoy **a full flexibility** on how they distribute their incentives: they can choose to reward more heavily LPs who bring more liquidity of one token, or they may prefer to better reward LPs who have set tight ranges and are hence earning more transaction fees from their position. They can also select whether they want to incentivize out of range liquidity or whether they want some holders of a specific token to earn boosted rewards.

Merkl accepts incentives of any ERC-20 token on any pool of the supported AMMs. For the list of chains and AMMs supported by Merkl (along with other info for each chain), check out [this page](./helpers.md).

Getting rewarded incurs no risk of funds or other smart contract interactions for LPs, and they can retain the custody of their liquidity while still receiving rewards. They can customize their positions to maximize their earnings from fees and incentives, enjoying all possibilities enabled by concentrated liquidity type of AMMs.
Merkl is compatible with liquidity position managers like [Gamma](https://app.gamma.xyz) or [Arrakis](https://www.arrakis.finance). This means that it's possible to provide liquidity via Gamma on a pool and to be rewarded without taking any further action (no need to stake the Gamma or Arrakis token).

The list of liquidity position managers supported for each AMM and chain can be found on [this page](./helpers.md).

Merkl has a low maintenance fee applied to incentives. Excluding gas when claiming rewards, there is no cost to use the platform for Liquidity Providers.

## Mechanism

Merkl is based on an off-chain script that looks on a given chain into the on-chain data for the pools that are incentivized and computes rewards for all the stakeholders of these pools during the period for which the script is ran. Based on this, the script aggregates all reward distribution data in a Merkle tree, then compressed into a Merkle root pushed on-chain to allow LPs to claim their rewards.

### Customizable Incentivization Formula

Precisely speaking, for a given pool with two tokens (A and B), the script looks into the swaps that took place on the pool and computes a reward score for each position according to:

- the fees earned by the position, which represent the liquidity of the position used by the pool
- the share of token A held by the position
- the share of token B held by the position

A different weight, chosen by the incentivizor, is attributed to each parameter. On top of that, incentivizors can further customize the distribution of the rewards for the pool by optionally allowing addresses which hold a specific token (veANGLE for example) to earn boosted rewards.

The exact distribution formula for a position in such a pool during a time period is as follows:

$$
[w_{\texttt{fees}} \times \frac{\texttt{fees earned by the position}}{\texttt{fees earned by the pool}}+ w_{\texttt{A}} \times \frac{\texttt{A in position}}{\texttt{A in pool}}+ w_{\texttt{B}} \times \frac{\texttt{B in position}}{\texttt{B in pool}} ] \times \texttt{optional gov token boost}
$$

### Distribution Epochs

The time periods (also called epochs) over which the script is ran for all the pools of a chain vary depending on the chain. Epoch lengths basically range between 8 hours to 3 days.

{% endhint %}

The length of an epoch is also the de facto amount of time between two reward distributions. For instance, if epoch length is 1 day for Ethereum, then Uniswap V3 LPs can claim new rewards at most every day on Merkl.

As the script on which Merkl is based aggregates all the pools on all the supported AMMs for a chain, liquidity providers with liquidity on different pools incentivized across different platforms on the same chain receive their full rewards in just one time at the end of every epoch.

In addition, as the system relies on a single Merkle root to handle distribution per chain, liquidity providers can claim all their token rewards (from potentially different pools on virtually many concentrated-liquidity AMMs) in just one transaction.

There is no need for liquidity providers to claim rewards at every epoch. Every Merkle Tree update takes into account the previous state of the reward tree and just adds new rewards on top (which is then reflected in the published Merkle root). Unclaimed rewards for an epoch can be claimed at any time in the future, along with all the rewards distributed in between.

### Dispute Periods

The script computing rewards and updating the reward Merkle root on-chain is ran by Angle Labs. It relies on an open source codebase available [here](TODO.com).

Merkle roots pushed on-chain may be based on off-chain computations, any stakeholder in the ecosystem may fetch on-chain data to run the script and verify the results sent.

Still, to allow anyone to permissionlessly take part in the system and at the same time to reduce the system's exposure to potential hacks or failures, every new Merkle root update is followed by a dispute period which allows anyone to contest the result. A new Merkle root that aggregates reward distribution data for a chain is only effective after this dispute period.

A dispute can be triggered by sending a pre-defined amount of `disputeToken` (most likely agEUR) to the contract distributing rewards. During a dispute, the Merkle root of the distribution contract is frozen to its last valid version. Disputes can then either be considered as valid, in which case the disputer is refunded and the disputed Merkle root is revoked, or invalid. In this last situation, the disputer loses its funds and the dispute period is restarted from scratch (which means the disputed tree is still not considered valid).

Dispute token, amount, and length can be obtained by directly querying the contract handling reward distribution on the chain of interest.

### Fee Structure

Merkl is free to use for liquidity providers claiming rewards. There is a maintenance fee of 3% applied to incentives that are sent by incentivizors.

This fee can be waived for pools which contain some specific whitelisted tokens. In particular, there is no fee for incentives sent to reward pools which have agEUR or another Angle Protocol stablecoin in it.

### Guides

Merkl is a solution any DAO or protocol can use to incentivize liquidity, and any liquidity provider can tap into to earn extra incentives without having to take any action after depositing liquidity.

Pools using Merkl are all listed at [merkl.angle.money](https://merkl.angle.money). Incentives on pools can also be deposited from there.

It's important to note though that the system for depositing incentives and claiming rewards can be integrated on any dApp. [This guide](integration-guide.md) explains how to list the liquidity pools of your choice on your dApp and how to build claim transactions for your users.

If you simply want to use Merkl, check out these guides to [make the best of Merkl as a liquidity provider](lp-guide.md) or to [distribute incentives](incentivizor-guide.md) with the system.
