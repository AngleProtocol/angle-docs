# Side products

Angle Labs launched and is currently developing Angle Protocol.

While doing so, it develops products that are helpful to Angle. Often, these can also bring value to other protocols and their users. This section of the documentation is made to present these side products built by Angle Labs.

## Merkl

Angle Labs implemented a specific reward mechanism for agEUR Uniswap V3 pools. This has expanded into Merkl, a generalized solution to better incentivize UniswapV3-like pool available to anyone.
