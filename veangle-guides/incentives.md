# Earning ANGLE rewards

To earn ANGLE distributed as part of the weekly emissions, users can deposit sanTokens, open long positions on the protocol with Perps, or deposit LP (liquidity providers) tokens. 

You can find all the available pools in the [Incentives page](https://dao.angle.money/#/stake) of the DAO App. 

After staking your tokens, you will start accruing ANGLE. You can claim your tokens from each card, or from the `Claim All` button on your left to claim all rewards from Perps and sanTokens pools in one transaction.
