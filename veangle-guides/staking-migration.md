# Staking Migration

Close to the veANGLE upgrade, funds staked on Angle Ethereum mainnet staking contracts will have to be migrated. This includes:

* All sanTokens staking contracts
* Gelato Uniswap agEUR/USDC LP
* Gelato Uniswap agEUR/wETH LP
* SushiSwap agEUR/ANG LP
* agEUR staking if it is not discontinued

Rewards will stop flowing to the older version of these contracts on the **Wednesday January 19th**.

## Migrating the funds

Stakers will need to take three steps to migrate their funds:

1. Unstake from old contracts
   * Optional: Lock ANGLE into veANGLE (required to get the boost on new contracts)
2. Approve new contracts
3. Stake on new contracts

The rewards will be interrupted for 5 hours from January 19th 4:30 PM UTC to January 20th 00:00 AM UTC.
