# Staking Migration

Close to the veANGLE upgrade, funds staked on Angle Ethereum mainnet staking contracts will have to be migrated. This includes:

* All sanTokens staking contracts
* Gelato Uniswap agEUR/USDC LP
* Gelato Uniswap agEUR/wETH LP
* SushiSwap agEUR/ANG LP
* agEUR staking if it is not discontinued

Rewards will stop flowing to the older version of these contracts on the **Wednesday January 19th**.

## Migrating the funds

Stakers will need to take three steps to migrate their funds:

1. Unstake from old contracts in the `Deprecated` section of [this page](https://dao.angle.money/#/stake) of our DAO App. If this section does not appear, it simply means that you have nothing to unstake from the old staking contracts.
   * Optional: Lock ANGLE into veANGLE (required to get an APR boost when staking on the new contracts)
2. Click on `All` in [the new staking page](https://dao.angle.money/#/stake) to see all available staking contracts
3. Approve new contracts
4. Stake on new contracts

Rewards to old staking contracts were interrupted on the 19th of January 2021 at 4:30pm UTC, and rewards to new staking contracts started on the 20th of January at 00:00 AM UTC.&#x20;
