# Locking ANGLE into veANGLE

ANGLE holders will be able to lock their tokens between 1 week and 4 years to obtain veANGLE, granting them voting power in the new governance system, boost on rewards for some staking contracts, and a share of the interests generated by the protocol.

Before locking ANGLE, make sure you read all the details about veANGLE and locking [here](../governance/veANGLE/README.md).

## Guide

ANGLE tokens can be locked at [dao.angle.money](https://dao.angle.money).

Before locking, remember that only one lock per address can be created. Once an address initiates a lock, it can either increase the lock expiration, or add tokens to the lock.

### Creating the lock

To create a lock, an expiration date and a quantity of tokens need to be specified. Then, two transactions are needed, first to approve the contract and then to create the lock with the specified amount of tokens.

### Increasing the lock or adding tokens

Once the lock has been created, to extend the lock expiration or add tokens, just click on one of the two buttons and choose a new expiration date (up to 4 years from now) or a quantity of tokens to add.
