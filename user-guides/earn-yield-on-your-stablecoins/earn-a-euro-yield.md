{% hint style="info" %}
Make sure you have enough [gas tokens](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-are-gas-fees) for the corresponding chain (ETH, MATIC, etc) in your wallet before you execute the deposit transaction into the Angle savings solution.

Depositing in the Euro savings product functions just like the Dollar savings product, but with EUR stablecoins instead of USD stablecoins (and you receive stEUR tokens in exchange for your deposit, instead of stUSD tokens)

For more information on how to deposit into the Euro savings product, please refer to the [Earn a Dollar Yield](earn-a-dollar-yield.md) guide.
