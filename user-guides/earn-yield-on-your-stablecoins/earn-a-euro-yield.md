# ðŸ’¶ Earn a Euro yield

{% hint style="info" %}
Make sure you have enough [gas tokens](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-are-gas-fees) for the corresponding chain (ETH, MATIC, etc) in your wallet before you execute the deposit transaction into the Angle savings solution.
{% endhint %}

1. Open the Angle app and go to the [`Earn Euro` ](https://app.angle.money/savings/eur)section
2. Select the `Deposit` tab and choose your preferred network (Ethereum, Arbitrum, Celo, etc)
3. Select the token you want to deposit among the list. You can use the token of your choice, from stablecoins like EURA, USDC, or USDT to more volatile assets such as ETH.\
   When depositing a token other than Angleâ€™s EURA, your assets will be automatically swapped into EURA before being deposited into the Angle savings solution â€” all in one transaction. Please note that **depositing EURA incurs no fees and no slippage**
4. Enter the amount. Please note that there is no minimum deposit
5. Approve the transaction
6. Click `Deposit` and confirm the transaction in your wallet. And voila! You will start earning yield immediately!

You receive stEUR tokens (staked EURA) in exchange for your deposit. stEUR is a yield-bearing stablecoin whose value continuously increase over time. The yield distributed to people depositing into the Angle savings solution is directly reflected into stEUR value. You have nothing to do, just hodl! Itâ€™s all automatic.

stEUR is an ERC20 token that is liquid and that you can trade anytime.

{% hint style="info" %}
The exchange rate between the EURA stablecoin and stEUR is not 1:1. stEUR value increases since its launch and is now higher than 1â‚¬. Itâ€™s therefore normal to receive a fewer amount of stEUR than the amount of EURA stablecoins deposited.
{% endhint %}

The Angle savings solution works as a swap and is integrated into several decentralized exchanges. Thus, you can also get stEUR (and earn its yield) by swapping your assets directly on the [Odos](https://www.odos.xyz/), [1inch](https://1inch.io/) or [ParaSwap](https://www.paraswap.io/) DEXs apps.
