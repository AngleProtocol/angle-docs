# ðŸ’° Earn yield on your stablecoins

Angle Protocol allows you to earn a **passive & native yield** on your stablecoins (and others assets like ETH) by depositing them into its [savings solution](https://www.angle.money/stusd).

The [yield](https://blog.angle.money/get-the-most-out-of-tradfi-and-defi-yields-on-your-usd-stablecoins) comes from the returns generated by assets backing USDA such as RWAs (T-bills) and DeFi yield-bearing assets, as well as interest paid by stablecoin borrowers.

With the Angle app, you can:
