# ðŸ’µ Earn a Dollar yield

{% hint style="info" %}
Make sure you have enough [gas tokens](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-are-gas-fees) for the corresponding chain (ETH, MATIC, etc) in your wallet before you execute the deposit transaction into the Angle savings solution.
{% endhint %}

1. Open the Angle app and go to the [`Earn Dollars`](https://app.angle.money/savings/usd) section
2. Select the `Deposit` tab and choose your favorite network (Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, etc)
3. Select the token you want to deposit among the list. You can use the token of your choice, from stablecoins like USDA, USDC, or USDT to more volatile assets such as ETH.\
   When depositing a token other than Angleâ€™s USDA, your assets will be automatically swapped into USDA before being deposited into the Angle savings solution â€” all in one transaction. Please note that **depositing USDA or USDC incurs no fees and no slippage**
4. Enter the amount. Please note that there is no minimum deposit
5. Approve the transaction
6. Click `Deposit` and confirm the transaction in your wallet. And voila! You will start earning yield immediately!

You will receive stUSD tokens (staked USDA) in exchange for your deposit. [stUSD](https://paragraph.xyz/@angleprotocol/get-the-most-out-of-tradfi-and-defi-yields-on-your-usd-stablecoins) is a yield-bearing stablecoin whose value continuously increase over time. The yield distributed to users depositing into the Angle savings solution is directly reflected into stUSD value. You have nothing to do, just hodl! Itâ€™s all automatic.

stUSD is an ERC20 token that is liquid and that you can trade anytime.

{% hint style="info" %}
The exchange rate between USD stablecoins and stUSD is not 1:1. stUSD value increases since its launch and is now higher than $1 USD. Itâ€™s therefore normal to receive a fewer amount of stUSD than the amount of USD stablecoins deposited.
{% endhint %}

The Angle savings solution works as a swap and is integrated into several decentralized exchanges. Thus, you can also get stUSD (and earn its yield) by swapping your assets directly on the [Odos](https://www.odos.xyz/), [1inch](https://1inch.io/) or [ParaSwap](https://www.paraswap.io/) DEXs apps.
