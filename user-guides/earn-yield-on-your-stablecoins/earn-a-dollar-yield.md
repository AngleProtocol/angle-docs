# ðŸ’µ Earn a Dollar yield

{% hint style="info" %}
Make sure you have enough [gas tokens](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-are-gas-fees) for the corresponding chain (ETH, MATIC, etc) in your wallet before you execute the deposit transaction into the Angle savings solution.
{% endhint %}

1. Open the Angle app and connect your wallet
2.  Go to the [`Earn section`](https://app.angle.money/savings/usd) section and click on the `Earn Dollars` tab\

4.  Look at the amount of stablecoins in your wallet that are not earning any yield. Then, check your total potential earnings for the next 30 days and 1 year if you deposit all detected assets. These estimates are based on the current APY displayed in the interface\

8. `Approve` the transaction and sign the message in your wallet
9. Click `Deposit` and confirm the transaction in your wallet. And voila! You will start earning yield immediately!

{% hint style="info" %}
The Angle app automatically detects stablecoins in your wallet that are not earning any yield.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
When depositing a token other than Angleâ€™s USDA, your assets will be automatically swapped for USDA before being deposited into the Angle savings solution â€” all in one transaction! Please note that depositing USDA or USDC incurs no fees and no slippage.
{% endhint %}

## The stUSD token

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/â€ŽEarn dollar user guide.â€Ž007.jpeg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You will receive stUSD tokens (staked USDA) in exchange for your deposit. [stUSD](https://paragraph.xyz/@angleprotocol/get-the-most-out-of-tradfi-and-defi-yields-on-your-usd-stablecoins) is a yield-bearing stablecoin whose value continuously increase over time. The yield distributed to users depositing into the Angle savings solution is directly reflected into stUSD value. You have nothing to do, just hodl! Itâ€™s all automatic.

stUSD is an ERC20 token that is liquid and that you can trade anytime.

{% hint style="info" %}
The exchange rate between USD stablecoins and stUSD is not 1:1. stUSD value increases since its launch and is now higher than $1 USD. Itâ€™s therefore normal to receive a fewer amount of stUSD than the amount of USD stablecoins deposited.
{% endhint %}

The Angle savings solution works as a swap and is integrated into several decentralized exchanges. Thus, you can also get stUSD (and earn its yield) by swapping your assets directly on the [Odos](https://www.odos.xyz/), [1inch](https://1inch.io/) or [ParaSwap](https://www.paraswap.io/) DEXs apps.
