1. Open the Angle app and go to the ‚ÄúEarn Dollars‚Äù or ‚ÄúEarn Euro‚Äù section
2. Select the `Redeem` tab and choose your favorite network (Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, ...)
3. Select the amount of stUSD or stEUR you want to redeem
4. Select the token you want to convert your stUSD or stEUR to, such as USDA, EURA, USDC, USDT, ETH, and more.\
   There is no slippage when converting stUSD back to USDA or stEUR back to EURA. If you convert your stUSD or stEUR to a token other than USDA or EURA (e.g., USDT, EURC, etc.), your stUSD or stEUR will first be swapped to USDA or EURA and then automatically swapped to the token of your choice with the lowest slippage
5. Approve the transaction
6. Click `Redeem` and confirm the transaction in your wallet

You have successfully converted your stUSD or stEUR yield-bearing stablecoins into another asset. You stop earning yield.

The Angle savings solution works as a swap and is integrated into several decentralized exchanges. Thus, you can also convert your stUSD or stEUR for another assets directly on the [Odos](https://www.odos.xyz/), [1inch](https://1inch.io/) or [ParaSwap](https://www.paraswap.io/) DEXs apps.
