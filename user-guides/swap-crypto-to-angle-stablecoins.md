{% hint style="info" %}
The Angle app relies on the Odos decentralized exchange (DEX) to provide the best swap rates to buy and sell Angle tokens.
{% endhint %}

## Swap settings

You can modify swap settings by clicking on the settings icon in the swap interface. You will be able to approve or not **permit signature**, grant **limited or unlimited approval**, and adjust **slippage tolerance**. You can also choose to receive your newly purchased tokens at a different address than the one from which you are selling your tokens for the exchange.

{% hint style="info" %}
Permits are offchain signatures that allow you to grant token approvals to the dApp's smart contract. It removes the need to execute new onchain transaction for each signature.
