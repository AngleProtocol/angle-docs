USDA borrowing occurs on the [Morpho protocol](https://app.morpho.org/borrow?network=mainnet&morphoPrice=0.2) (whereas EURA borrowing is managed by Angle Protocol and takes place on the Angle app).

On Morpho, it‚Äôs possible to get USDA loans with various collaterals, especially liquid staking tokens (LSTs) and liquid restaking tokens (LRTs).

Learn how to borrow on Morpho in this [guide](https://docs.morpho.org/interface/dapp-guides/).
