# üè¶ Borrow USDA

USDA borrowing occurs on the [Morpho app](https://app.morpho.org/borrow?network=mainnet\&morphoPrice=0.2) (whereas EURA borrowing is managed by the Angle Protocol and takes place on the Angle app).

On Morpho, it‚Äôs possible to get USDA loans with various collaterals, especially liquid staking tokens (LSTs) and liquid restaking tokens (LRTs) such as wstETH, Re7WETH, Re7USDT, ezETH, pufETH, PT-USDe, PT-weETH, PT-ezETH, and more.

Learn how to borrow on Morpho in this [guide](https://docs.morpho.org/interface/dapp-guides/).
